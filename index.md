### About

How to incorporate **human knowledge** in declarative forms into **robot behaviors**?

**Knowledge representation and reasoning** is one of the earliest research topics in AI. From Prolog to PDDL, many declarative paradigms have been used in robot systems for representing human knowledge. Researchers have used them for representing and reasoning with commonsense knowledge, action knowledge, temporal knowledge, etc. However, people frequently find those methods not performing well in scalability and robustness, which is particularly important in robotics. 

Robots frequently face complex tasks that require multiple actions, and performing those actions sometimes does not lead to desired results. What makes robot behavior generation more challenging is that robot perception is partial and unreliable. To address those challenges, **planning under uncertainty** and **reinforcement learning** methods have been widely used to help robots achieve long-term goals in presence of their imperfect sensing and actuating capabilities. However, those planning and learning methods are not designed for representing or reasoning with declarative knowledge, which tends to be abstract, incomplete, and not always correct. 

We aim to bring together robotics researchers who work on knowledge-based methods, and robot sequential decision-making methods, including planning under uncertainty and reinforcement learning, to explore ways of leveraging the complementary features from the two research areas. Through this workshop, we hope to identify benchmark problems for evaluation purposes, discuss recent advances, and highlight opportunities that deserve further investigations.
