### About

How to incorporate **human knowledge** in declarative forms into **robot behaviors**?

**Knowledge representation and reasoning** is one of the earliest research topics in AI. From Prolog to PDDL, many declarative paradigms have been used in robot systems for representing human knowledge. Researchers have used them for representing and reasoning with commonsense knowledge, action knowledge, temporal knowledge, etc. However, people frequently find those methods **not performing well in scalability and robustness**, which is particularly important in robotics. 

**Numerical approaches** to both planning and learning have dominated recent developments in every level of robot behaviors. Such success has quickly been followed by a need for AI to be intelligible in order to be trusted. Current trends in **explainable AI** and **neuro-symbolic reasoning** attempt to marry some of the desirable features of traditional logic-based approaches with the generalization offered by more recent numerical methods.

We aim to focus on a general and currently pressing need for declarative knowledge - be it either for the purpose of explainability, abstraction, efficiency, or robustness - to be incorporated into the decision making process. We intend to bring together robotics researchers from the once distant fields of knowledge representation and reasoning, symbolic and motion planning, reinforcement learning, and more generally machine learning for behavior recognition and synthesis, whose worlds are inevitably colliding. The workshop will explore novel ways to leverage complementary features of the different forms of decision making in order to inform the future research of deliberative systems relying on declarative knowledge that can be learned from, and shared with, humans. We aim at identifying benchmark problems for evaluation purposes, discuss recent advances, and highlight opportunities that deserve further investigations.
